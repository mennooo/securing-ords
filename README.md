How to secure a REST API build with Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS)

## Demo API
The demo that makes the most sence is securing a REST API for a B2B E-commerce application. B2B e-commerce, short for business-to-business, electronic commerce, is selling products or services between businesses through the internet via an online sales portal.

Oracle APEX is perfect because you can build database-driven applications using the web browser.

For this demo we build an B2C (bussiness-to-consumer) E-commerse application on top of a **Packaged App** in Oracle APEX: the **Sample Database Application**. This will be an Oracle Jet application because then it makes sence to use a REST API. The Oracle JET API provides the oj.OAuth authorization plugin which supports the OAuth 2.0 open protocol.

The goal is to create a REST API for the B2C where they can:
- Place new orders
- See products
- See order history
